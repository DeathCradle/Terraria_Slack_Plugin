# Terraria_Slack_Plugin
Slack Integration for Terraria

It's a simple plugin for TDSM : https://github.com/DeathCradle/Terraria-s-Dedicated-Server-Mod
It allows you to post msgs about users who have joined and left the server

Open the SlackPlugin.cs file and populate the values for the private variables. If you need help getting the slack webhook url, 
look up slack webhook url in google!

Build the project, then drop the SlackPlugin.dll in the Plugins folder of TDSM. You must ALSO take the newtonsoft.json dll
and put it in the main directory of TDSM.
